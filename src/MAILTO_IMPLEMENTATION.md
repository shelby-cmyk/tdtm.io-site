All CTA buttons now open the user's default email client with:
- **To:** hello@tdtm.io

## üìù Updated Components & Sections

  </a>
</Button>
```
**Email Subject:** "Explore the Ecosystem"

---

### 2. **Navigation Header (App.tsx)**

#### Desktop Nav - "Get Started" Button

### 4. **Pricing Section (PricingSection.tsx)**

#### Pricing Tier CTAs (3 buttons)
All pricing tier buttons now use dynamic mailto based on tier:

  Get Started
</a>

}
```
**Email Subject:** "Schedule a Demo"

---

### 6. **Demo Booking Form (DemoBookingForm.tsx)**

#### Form Submission
When users submit the form, it now:
1. Opens their email client
2. Pre-fills the email to `hello@tdtm.io`
3. Includes all form data in the email body

**Email Subject:** "Demo Request - [Company Name]"

**Email Body Template:**
```
Name: [User's Name]
Email: [User's Email]
Company: [Company Name]
Phone: [Phone Number or 'Not provided']
Company Size: [Selected Size]

Message:
[User's Message or 'No additional message provided']
```

**User Experience:**
- User fills out form
- Clicks "Request Demo & Consultation"
- Email client opens with pre-filled data
- User sends the email
- Toast notification: "Opening your email client. Please send the email to submit your request."

## üé® Technical Implementation

### Using `asChild` Pattern
All buttons use Shadcn's `asChild` prop to render as `<a>` tags:

```tsx
<Button asChild>
  <a href="mailto:...">Button Text</a>
</Button>
```

**Benefits:**
- Maintains button styling
- Semantic HTML (anchor tag for links)
- Keyboard accessible
- Works with screen readers

### URL Encoding
All mailto links use proper URL encoding:
- `subject=` uses `%20` for spaces
- Form data uses `encodeURIComponent()` for special characters
- Subject lines are descriptive and contextual

---

## üìß Email Subject Lines (Complete List)

| Button/Action | Email Subject |
|---------------|---------------|
| Hero: "Schedule a Demo" | Schedule a Demo |
| Hero: "Explore The Ecosystem" | Explore the Ecosystem |
| Nav: "Get Started" | Get Started |
| Mobile Nav: "Get Started" | Get Started |
| Pricing: TDTM Pixel | Get Started - TDTM Pixel |
| Pricing: White Label | Contact Sales - White Label |
| Pricing: Audience Builder | Schedule Demo - Audience Builder |
| Pricing: Consultation | Schedule Consultation |
| Chat Widget: Demo | Schedule a Demo |
| Form Submission | Demo Request - [Company Name] |

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Email client doesn't open
**Cause:** User has no default email client configured  
**Solution:** Show fallback contact info or chat widget

### Issue: Subject line looks weird
**Cause:** URL encoding visible in some clients  
**Solution:** This is normal; most modern clients decode it properly

### Issue: Form data doesn't appear
**Cause:** Email body too long (OS limit ~2000 characters)  
**Solution:** Keep form fields concise or use shorter format

### Issue: User abandons email
**Cause:** Friction of switching to email client  
**Solution:** Add clear value proposition in CTA

### A/B Testing Ideas:
